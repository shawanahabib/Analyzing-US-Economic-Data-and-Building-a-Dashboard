# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard
This project was done to fulfill the requirements for *Python for Data Science and AI* course requirements. Two datasets are used: 'Unemployment' and 'GDP'.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an indicator of the economy's performance. A high GDP indicates the economy is performing well whereas a lower GDP indicates poor performance. This project examines how changes in GDP affect the unemployment rate.
